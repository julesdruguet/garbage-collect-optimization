# Sensor

VL53L0X

+ comes with c API for range sensing.
+ can do hardware standby, has interupt.
+ I2C protocol (up to 400kHz)
+ 2.6-3.5V, 3.3V possible
   in "HW standby" 3-7uA typ 5uA
   in "SW standby" 4-9uA typ 6uA
   in "active ranging 33ms" avg consumption 19mA
   could also just be powered off

# MCU
  needs support for C and I2C, aswell as low power.
  can be 8bit, 16bit or 32bit
  
  8bit:
  STM8L162R8
    8bit low power mcu
    Has 8bit C compiler "CXSTM8"
    1x I2C (fast mode 400kHz)
    2x SPI
    3x UART
      Thus possibility for more sensors
    AES encryption (for data security and integrity, it is IoT after all)
    1.65V-3.6V, 3.3v possible
    in "low power runmode" 5.8-6.8 uA
    in "low power waitmode" 3.7-4.1 uA
    
# Communication to the world
  Wifi, Zigbee, GSM.
  Has to be low power, with sleep capability.

  2.4GHz uses alot of power,
  GSM is getting phased out, longevity limited.
  
  Z-wave?
  
  Zigbee - Telit
    Interface: RS232 TTL
  
    Ze51 - 1km range (line of sight, external antenna)
     2-3.6V, 3.3V possible
      Rx: 26mA
      Tx: 35mA
      Standby: 2uA
      Sleep: 1uA
    
    Ze61 - 4km range (line of sight, external antenna)
      2-3.6V, 3.3V possible
      Rx: 31mA
      Tx: 150mA
      Standby: 2.5uA
      Sleep: 1.5uA

# Complete system
  # sensor power
    
    Sensor is off most of the time, only senses 2 times a day.
    Assume HW standby if not measuring.
      Power = (Ihw*V*(24h-2*measuretime)+Imeas*V*2*measuretime)/24hr
    Normal measure time is 33ms, maybe we want more samples? lets assume 10 measurements and we take the average.
    33ms*10 = 0.33s = 0.33s/3600 = 0.00009166666667hr
      Power = (Ihw*V*(24hr-2*0.00009166666667hr)+Imeas*V*2*0.00009166666667hr)/24hr = 0.00001697883229 Wh = 16.97883229 uWh
