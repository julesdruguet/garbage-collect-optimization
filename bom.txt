# Sensor

VL53L0X

+ comes with c API for range sensing.
+ can do hardware standby, has interupt.
+ I2C protocol (up to 400kHz)
+ 2.6-3.5V, 3.3V possible
   in "HW standby" 3-7uA typ 5uA
   in "SW standby" 4-9uA typ 6uA
   in "active ranging 33ms" avg consumption 19mA
   could also just be powered off

# MCU
  needs support for C and I2C, aswell as low power.
  can be 8bit, 16bit or 32bit
  
  8bit:
  STM8L162R8
    8bit low power mcu
    Has 8bit C compiler "CXSTM8"
    1x I2C (fast mode 400kHz)
    2x SPI
    3x UART
      Thus possibility for more sensors
    AES encryption (for data security and integrity, it is IoT after all)
    1.65V-3.6V, 3.3v possible
    in "low power runmode" 6.2-6.8 uA (-40 to 55 degrees C) 6.73 (at max 25)
    in "low power waitmode" 3.7-4.1 uA (-40 to 55 degrees C) 4.21 (at max 25)
    in "active-halt mode" - RTC running - 0.92-1.32uA (-40 to 55 degrees C) 2.25 (at max 25)
    
# Communication to the world
  Wifi, Zigbee, GSM.
  Has to be low power, with sleep capability.
  https://predictabledesigns.com/wireless_technologies_bluetooth_wifi_zigbee_gsm_lte_lora_nb-iot_lte-m/
  
  2.4GHz uses alot of power,
  GSM is getting phased out, longevity limited.
  
  Z-wave?
  
  Zigbee - Telit
    Interface: RS232 TTL
  
    Ze51 - 1km range (line of sight, external antenna)
     2-3.6V, 3.3V possible
      Rx: 26mA
      Tx: 35mA
      Standby: 2uA
      Sleep: 1uA
    
    Ze61 - 4km range (line of sight, external antenna)
      2-3.6V, 3.3V possible
      Rx: 31mA
      Tx: 150mA
      Standby: 2.5uA
      Sleep: 1.5uA

# Complete system
  # sensor power
    
    Sensor is off most of the time, only senses 2 times a day.
    Assume HW standby if not measuring.
      Power = (Ihw*V*(24h-2*measuretime)+Imeas*V*2*measuretime)/24hr
    Normal measure time is 33ms, maybe we want more samples? lets assume 10 measurements and we take the average.
    33ms*10 = 0.33s = 0.33s/3600 = 0.00009166666667hr
      Power = (Ihw*V*(24hr-2*0.00009166666667hr)+Imeas*V*2*0.00009166666667hr)/24hr = 16.97883229 uWh @ 3.3v
  # MCU power
      MCU is in active-halt mode most of the time, when RTC triggers a sensor event, MCU wakes up to LP-runmode, triggers sensor - goes to LP-waitmode - recieves sensor interrupt - wakes to LP-runmode, reads sensor, triggers sensor - etc, untill sensor has read 10 times - LP-runmode, does average of 10 readings, sends date to communication module that transfers it along - goes back to active-halt.
      
      Thus MCU is in LP-waitmode for 10*33ms. In LP-runmode for lets say 10s and in active halt for 24hr - 2(wait + run)
      Assuming max power 25 degrees interval:
      Power = (Ihalt*V*(24hr-2(twait+trun))+Iwait*V*twait+Irun*V*trun)/24hr = 7.425848 uWh @ 3.3v
      
      
 # To run sensor and MCU for an hr is 24,4uW, for 24 hrs is 585,7uW. for 365 days is 0,2137W. 
 Mouser has a heat resistant button cell (-40 to 125 degrees C) that holds 1000mAh at 3v ie. 3Wh. This cell would keep sensor and MCU running for ~15.4 years. 
 
 # Now lets add communication to the world. This is expensive, power-budget wise.
